# Noted : 
This project is base on coding-in-public / astro-blog-tutorial in :
- YouTube Astro Blog Course playlist : https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoqZcxvpWzzeRwF8TEpXHtO7KYY6cNJeF
- Github : https://github.com/coding-in-public/astro-blog-tutorial

This project still not finish yet, there's a couple issue:
- Pagination didn't work, maybe because some typo in the code that I type.
- Decpricated in Astro.glob, so next time need to fix it.
- RSS feed in page route displayed 404, next will fix it.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
